                                <p>If you’re here, you must really love video games.</p>
                                <p>I am a gamer myself. The type that would play anything and everything that interests me.</p>
                                <p>Maybe like some of you, I play a lot of AAA games made by Ubisoft, Valve, Blizzard, etc. and I wondered, </p>
                                <p><b>Are there Philippine made video games?</b></p>
                                <p><b>Are they available here?</b></p>
                                <p>Of course, as a Filipino myself, it’s a good feeling to know that a video game was made in the Philippines. Because of that, I am willing to support these Philippine made video games. </p>
                                <p>Maybe I got your attention, and you are also wondering the same thing.</p>
                                <p>I did a little research and have found some games for you.</p>

                                            <p>Game development in the Philippines started way back in the 1992 with Japan's booming arcades and console development. Many Philippine based developers were established, including Micronet Software Manila (MSM), a smaller company owned by of Japan based Micronet Co. Ltd., and Japan Media Programing-Cebu (JAMP-Cebu). Since most of the content developed by these companies was exclusive for their Japan-based holding company, much of their accomplishments was not heard off in the newspapers, radios, or news in the TV. </p>
                                            <p>The Asian financial crisis in 1997 added to the problem, most of these game developers had begun cutting back on the smaller companies based in the Philippines because of the shrinking market of entertainment products such as video games interfering with further video game production in the Philippines.</p>

                                            <p>In mid-1997, a small company called 'Id Software' released a game called 'Quake' into the world. Id Software is a small independent developer company and unlike previous games, Quake was developed, published, advertised, and sold by the same small company.</p>
                                            <p>This reduced the cost of developing video games, which was mostly been advertising and promotions. Id Software depended on "viral marketing" - distributing freely playable demo versions to the public, allowing a movement to create a demand for the final version of the game.</p>
                                            <p>The popularity of the internet at that time contributed for the worldwide release and promotion of Quake becoming what soon became the practice of video game developers today. By 1999, Id Software showed that a small independent company can reach their goals with small advertising and promotional budget.</p>
                                            <p>Id Software's success sparked the rise of independent US-based developers years later, such as Bioware, Blizzard, Valve Software, and Digital Extremes who had been successful in their own.</p>
                                            <p>By 2000, the success of these start-ups motivated other independent developers in the Philippines.</p>

                                        <p>Among the game developers that was built from 2000 were Fluxion Games, eSoftInteractive, and Anino Entertainment. Game development slowly started entering the mainstream media by the development of Anito: Defend a Land Enraged in 2001 by Anino Entertainment.</p>
                                        <p>It was one of the few video games released in the 2000's to include the Philippines' culture and history as a means for creating a video game. Because of Anito's good story and art design, Anino Entertainment soon had fans in the Easter Europe market. However, constraints in marketing and promotion budgets resulted in limited exposure to the biggest market for video games at that time, the United States.</p>
                                        <p>Because of that, entry of promising independent video game developers received very little attention from mainstream media and the government. This goes through Tantra Online developed by ABS-CBN Entertainment. With it being a Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), it needed a huge player base for it to survive. A lack of a good backstory was the main reason why gamers lacked interest in Tantra Online, resulting to a small player base and, in turn, slowly dwindled down.</p>
                                        <span class="nextSlide" id="slide-batobb">Then...</span></div>

                                <p>Then, the success of Anino eventually gave way to a new wave of companies that allows long development times. This included Laro Co. (Now known as PixelStream), Matahari, and Filpside Games. This also paved way to the creation of IGDA Manila, the Philippine chapter of Independent Game Developers Association across the globe.</p>
                                <p>By 2007, the game development companies who were part of IGDA Manila eventually built GDAP (Game Developers Association of the Philippines) to further expand worldwide exposure of local video game developers and improve their ability to promote their games. GDAP's founding members included Anino Entertainment and Anino Mobile, Flipside Games, Glyph Studios, Matahari Studios, PixelStream, Indigo Entertainment, and Secret Six.</p><button type="button" class="nextSlideBtn reset button-outline" id="thirdslidereset">Oooh!

                                        <h3>Smartphone</h3>
                                        <p>In 2007, the iPhone was released by Apple with Steve Jobs stating that it is "a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone". A year later, Google's G1 was released with the Android Operating System. Their touchscreen feature has led to the development of many apps on their platform through Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. This made Smartphones a possible option to further distribute video games.</p>

                                        <p>Steam Curators are individuals or organizations that make recommendations to help others discover interesting games in the Steam catalog. IGDA Manila is one of these Steam Curators and they are working hard to show Steam users Philippine developed video games. To date, they have curated 63 different video games that either include Filipinos in the development team of foreign developers or Philippine developed video games.</p>

                                        <p>Another way of distributing video games is through personal websites. In 2010, a digital game developed by 'By Implication' won top honors in Microsoft Imagine Cup under the Game Design Category. The theme of the competition was "Imagine a world where technology helps solve the toughest problems". By Implication's project manager, Kenneth Yu, stated that, "The basis of Wildfire’s gameplay is the massive outpouring of volunteer support that emerged from the wake of Typhoon Ondoy (Hurricane Ketsana) last year. We believe that volunteerism is an effective way of tackling big problems, and we wanted to encourage this throughout the game."</p>

                                <p>Since then, a lot of video games developed in the Philippines. Because of the internet and the many platforms to release your games, a lot of developers are experimenting and trying to find out where they would specifically develop and market their games. </p>
