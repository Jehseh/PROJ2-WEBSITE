            was one of the first few games that was released worldwide through the Google Play Store.

        <p>Warrior Defense is a spin-off the "Tower Defense" genre where you buy towers and place towers
            in pre-existing areas for your towers, but in Warrior Defense you buy units and place them
            on the ground. Those units can move around to help in defending while you use your spells.
